            <p>John Agnew, also known as "Johnny-Quandoh" and "Goldilocks" during his time as a stuntman, reminisces about his various nicknames. He initially aspired to be a stuntman due to his childhood fascination with action-packed films. However, as life progressed and family became a priority, he made a conscious decision to protect his physical well-being, leading to a transition from stuntwork.</p>
	    <p>John's life philosophy revolves around the idea that there's no one "right" way to live. He believes that societal expectations and advice often overlook individual differences. Ultimately, he advocates for making choices that align with one's unique values and desires, emphasizing happiness and well-being as the true measures of success.</p>
